                    Responsive Design is a web design approach that is used to create online content that seamlessly adjusts to various screen sizes and mobile devices.
                    Responsive design makes sure that images and text areas are not larger that the screen width. 
                    The ultimate goal of Responsive design is to avoid the unnecessary step of resizing, scrolling, zooming, or panning of site to view it comfortably.

                    Responsive design has become more important in the past 5 year than ever before and this is due to 3 main reasons.

                    The first reason is that it greatly improves user experience. A website with proper responsive design will look great on any screen size and any device and provide the user with a pleasant experience. A site without responsive design may look distorted with unaligned images or jumbled up text. With new websites popping up everyday, it very important to make a good impression on your users to ensure they come back to your website instead of going elsewhere, and responsive design is one way to provide great user experience.

                    Another reason that responsive design is so important is that people are browsing the web on their phones more and more as seen on the graph on the right.
                    In 2021 mobile phones generated approximately 56% of all online traffic, just 10 years earlier in 2011, mobile phones only generated 6% of website visits. 
                    Nowadays, Mobile phones actually generate more traffic to the web than every other medium combined. So by using responsive design, developers and designers are able to reach the evergrowing mobile audience.

                    And finally, by using responsive design, the maintenance cost of a website becomes lower. As mentioned earlier, a site with responsive design can be used on desktop or phone and anything in between, but sites without responsive design may require separate sites for each different platform which can really ramp up maintenance costs. With responsive design, only one site needs to be managed and updated.

                    There are two ways I would recommend adding responsive design to your website.
                    The first would to be to use pre-existing css frameworks (css being the stylesheet language for most websites). A couple frameworks that are easy to get started with are CSS Grid, Pure CSS, and Bootstrap. Each of these frameworks are heavily documented and have easy to follow instructions.
                    The second way to incorporate responsive design would be to create your own custom responsive layouts by following tutorials from online websites like W3schools, Codecademy, and Freecodecamp.
